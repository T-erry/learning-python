    # print()function determines what character or string is printed at the end of each print statement. 
    # By default, the print() function adds a newline character ('\n') at the end, which moves the cursor to the next line.

    # However, when you use end="", it means that you want to suppress the default newline character and specify an empty string ("") to be printed instead. 
    # This results in the next printed content appearing on the same line.
